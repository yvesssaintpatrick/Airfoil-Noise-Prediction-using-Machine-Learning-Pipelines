Overview

This project focuses on creating a machine learning pipeline to predict airfoil noise levels using a modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self-Noise dataset.

Project Structure

This project is divided into four comprehensive parts, each building on the previous one to develop an end-to-end machine learning solution.

Part 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation

Loading Data: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows are identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
Handling Null Values: Rows with null values are dropped to maintain dataset quality.
Data Transformation: Necessary transformations are applied, and the cleaned data is stored in Parquet format for efficient processing.

Part 2: Building the Machine Learning Pipeline

Pipeline Stages: The pipeline is created with three stages:
VectorAssembler: Assembles feature columns into a single feature vector.
StandardScaler: Scales the feature vector to standardize the data.
Linear Regression: A regression model to predict the sound level.
Model Training: The pipeline processes the data and trains the model.

Part 3: Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared (RÂ²).
Model Insights: Understanding the model's predictive capabilities and identifying areas for improvement.

Part 4: Model Persistence
Model Saving: The trained model is saved for future use.
Model Loading: The saved model is loaded and verified to ensure its integrity and usability.
Technologies Used

Apache Spark: For distributed data processing and machine learning pipeline creation.
PySpark: The Python API for Spark, enabling integration with Python-based ML workflows.
Parquet: A columnar storage file format for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical computations.

Use Cases

This machine learning pipeline can be applied to various real-world scenarios, including:

Aeronautics Design: Predicting noise levels for airfoil designs in planes and sports cars.
Automotive Industry: Enhancing vehicle design by minimizing noise and improving aerodynamics.
Manufacturing: Optimizing product designs to meet noise regulations and improve customer satisfaction.
Environmental Studies: Analyzing noise pollution and its impact on surrounding areas.
Importance of the Project

The ability to predict airfoil noise levels accurately is crucial for several reasons:

Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring designs meet noise regulations.
Customer Satisfaction: Improving the user experience by reducing noise levels.
Design Efficiency: Enabling engineers to create more efficient and quieter designs.
Cost Savings: Reducing the need for costly physical prototypes and tests by relying on accurate predictions.
By creating an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, this project not only automates the prediction process but also ensures that the model can be easily updated and maintained, providing a scalable and efficient solution for noise prediction in airfoil design.

By leveraging the power of Apache Spark and machine learning, this project demonstrates a robust approach to solving complex predictive modeling problems, with broad applicability across industries that value efficiency, regulatory compliance, and customer satisfaction.
